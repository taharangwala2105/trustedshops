I have developed the required task on Eclipse with Selenium WebDriver in Java programming language. The folder uploaded is the project with multiple java files divided according to the task numbers.
1. Go to Main.java and run the code, The Page title task will execute if all other lines until line 18 are commented. 
2. To execute The Grade task script uncomment lines 8 and 9 and execute the code.
3. To exxecute the icon hover task, uncomment lines 11 & 12 and comment lines 8 & 9 then execute the code.
4. To execute all one star reviews task, uncomment lines 14 & 15 and comment lines 11 & 12 then execute the code.
5. To execute sum of percentages task, uncomment lines 17 & 18 and comment lines 14 & 15 then execute the code.


Furthermore to the tests conducted. I would also check:  
1. If the average score being graded is correct or not.
2. If the page is responsive.
3. If the percentages of customers scoring particular grades is being calculated correctly because in my tests the percentage calculated was greater than 100%.
4. I would check if the date and time of the comments are matching.
5. Other than the functionalities, i would also explore the UI/UX for inconsistencies.
